# Event-driven maintenance

No cron, interval, or timer runs in this service. Every piece of recurring maintenance is attached to the event that
makes it necessary, and `deno.json` does not enable the `cron` unstable feature, so `Deno.cron` is not available to
call. This document is the mapping from each retired job to the event that replaced it.

## What the design guarantees

- **Nothing runs because time passed.** With no traffic and no operator, no work happens. That is deliberate: the
  gateway should not spend provider probes, KV writes, or log reads on an idle system.
- **Durable state waits, it does not leak.** Pending reconciliation markers, capacity snapshots, and retained analytics
  rows are all stored durably. Their next event settles, samples, or prunes them; none of them expires or is lost
  because a job did not run.
- **Debounce is a bucket for event sampling, and a shared lease for read revalidation.** Event-driven capacity sampling
  keeps one probe per fifteen-minute history bucket (`PROVIDER_CAPACITY_HISTORY_BUCKET_MS`), and analytics pruning keeps
  one scan per analytics bucket. A normal capacity read revalidates at most once per `PROVIDER_CAPACITY_READ_FRESH_MS`
  (30 s) through the same durable lease, so two processes still cannot probe at once, and a same-bucket refresh
  overwrites that bucket's point instead of adding one.
- **Maintenance never delays a user request.** Every hook is fired fire-and-forget, and the reconciliation sweep is
  gate-guarded, so a sweep with nothing due costs one KV read.
- **Reconciliation has a manual path.** Reading a key's paid-fallback ledger schedules best-effort reconciliation of due
  work without awaiting it; the response can still contain unreconciled rows.

## Deferred paid-fallback logs on an idle Mac

**Decision for issue #854 (2026-10-04):** do not approve an autonomous retry or a Mac-only timer. Retain the deliberate
no-timer policy and the durable pending state described below.

The no-timer policy is intentional for the Mac as well as the shared handler. A terminal event starts one best-effort
reconciliation pass. If the provider log is absent, late, or the fetch fails, `deferPaidFallbackReconciliationV3()`
records the bounded durable backoff and leaves the request pending; it does not schedule delivery at that timestamp. An
otherwise idle Mac may therefore retain the request's pending row and reserved exposure until a later authorized event
(startup, another terminal event, an admin ledger read, or an admission that needs reconciliation). No usage is settled
without the authoritative provider log. A blocked admission reconciles work that is due before its bounded retry, so a
late log can release the original request's exposure without reintroducing periodic maintenance; if the work is not due
or the log remains unavailable, admission stays fail-closed.

## What an operator should expect

- Capacity history converges on the next request or the next admin read: a normal capacity read uses the 30-second
  window (`PROVIDER_CAPACITY_READ_FRESH_MS`) to trigger revalidation, but if revalidation throws, the read returns the
  last known snapshot, which may be older than 30 seconds. The durable capacity history bucket remains fifteen minutes.
  Paid-fallback terminal events and ledger reads schedule best-effort reconciliation; a ledger read can return before
  settlement. `?refresh=live` on the capacity endpoint still forces an immediate probe.
- On a busy gateway the events arrive continuously, so cadence is effectively the same as the retired jobs were, without
  the idle-time work.
