# Deno Deploy Free-tier audit — 2026-08-09

## Scope and conclusion

This is a read-only audit of the Ubiquity DAO organization and the deployed
`ai-ubq-fi` service. It uses the Deno Deploy console, the organization metrics
dashboard, the current repository at `development` (`3639d611b9ec`), and the
official pricing page. No plan change, app deletion, deployment, or production
configuration change was performed.

The read-only production health check at 07:31:34 UTC returned HTTP 200 and
reported git SHA `3639d611b9ec9ad3d5bd8f2a538df65375e2a47d` with deployment
`s648v6w0rzbh`, matching the checked-out `HEAD` used for the code review.

**Conclusion: do not downgrade to the Free plan with the current utilization.**
Outbound traffic, KV reads, KV writes, and active-app count already exceed Free
limits. A seven-day linear projection also exceeds the request and CPU limits.
The recent optimization and the later usage spike are separate effects: the
code reduced the intended warm-path accounting work, then real production use
grew substantially as more coding projects used the service. The later V3
ledger also added durable admission and dispatch accounting, so raw KV totals
cannot be used as proof that the whole system became cheaper per request.

## Official Free limits

The current [Deno Deploy pricing page](https://deno.com/deploy/pricing/)
lists these monthly Free-plan limits for an organization:

| Metric | Free limit |
| --- | ---: |
| HTTP requests | 1,000,000 |
| CPU time | 15 hours |
| Memory time | 350 GiB·h |
| Outbound traffic | 20 GB |
| Deno KV reads | 450,000 units |
| Deno KV writes | 300,000 units |
| Active apps | 20 |

The pricing page is the authority for the current limits. Deno's usage and
changelog documentation also describe Free-plan over-limit behavior: request,
bandwidth, CPU, or memory overages can pause a Free organization until the
next billing cycle.

## Billing snapshot

Captured from
[`console.deno.com/ubiquity-dao/~/billing`](https://console.deno.com/ubiquity-dao/~/billing)
at 07:27 UTC on 2026-08-09. The billing cycle is Jul 31–Aug 31, 2026. The
organization is currently on Pro ($20/month), with a $200 usage spend limit
and approximately $1.99 usage-based spend. Console values are rounded and
recent usage can lag in the invoice preview.

| Metric | Current console usage | Free limit | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| HTTP requests | 0.3M | 1M | under now; projection is over |
| CPU time | 9.4 h | 15 h | under now; projection is over |
| Memory time | 229.6 GiB·h | 350 GiB·h | under now |
| Outbound traffic | 87 GiB | 20 GB | **over 4×** |
| KV reads | 3.3M units | 450,000 | **over 7×** |
| KV writes | 0.6M units | 300,000 | **over 2×** |
| Active apps | 24 | 20 | **4 apps over** |

The Pro plan's larger included amounts explain why the current invoice is only
about $1.99 in usage charges; those Pro allowances are not Free allowances.
Using the rounded console values directly, the current excess is about 67 GiB
of outbound traffic, 2.85M KV reads, 0.3M KV writes, and four apps. The unit
labels differ (the console displays GiB while the Free limit is published as
GB), so these are order-of-magnitude comparisons rather than invoice-exact
byte conversions. Requests, CPU, and memory are still below Free at this
instant; that does not erase the four resources already over their limits.

## Recent metrics and projections

The Metrics dashboard was read at approximately 06:46–06:50 UTC. Values below
are organization totals unless an `ai-ubq-fi` value is shown separately.

### Last seven days

| Metric | Organization | `ai-ubq-fi` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Requests | 254,967 | 209,676 |
| CPU time | 8.5 h | 6 h |
| Incoming traffic | 85.3 GiB | 83.6 GiB |
| Outgoing traffic | 82.9 GiB | 81.8 GiB |
| KV reads | 3,045,320 | 2,988,453 |
| KV writes | 596,431 | 593,723 |

Using a simple 31-day / 7-day linear projection for this billing cycle gives
approximately 1.13M requests, 37.7 CPU hours, 367 GiB outbound, 13.5M KV
reads, and 2.64M KV writes. This is a planning projection, not a promise: it
assumes the recent production workload continues and does not account for
future traffic changes.

`ai-ubq-fi` represents about 82% of requests, 71% of CPU time, 99% of outbound
traffic, 98% of KV reads, and 99.5% of KV writes in the seven-day window. Its
outbound average is about **409 KiB per request** (binary KiB), with about
14.25 KV reads and 2.83 KV writes per request.

### Longer windows

| Window | Scope | Requests | CPU | Outbound | KV reads | KV writes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Last 30 days | Organization | 645,787 | 20 h | 164.2 GiB | 7,226,336 | 1,353,973 |
| Last 30 days | `ai-ubq-fi` | 414,535 | 12.3 h | 160.8 GiB | 7,134,322 | 1,342,897 |
| Last 90 days | Organization | 754,400 | 24.6 h | 166.8 GiB | 7,242,853 | 1,357,431 |
| Last 90 days | `ai-ubq-fi` | 426,372 | 12.8 h | 161.1 GiB | 7,150,838 | 1,346,355 |

The seven-day window is materially hotter than the earlier 90-day baseline.
The 30-day and 90-day figures also show that almost all KV and egress usage is
from `ai-ubq-fi`, not the other 23 apps.

### Fixed-end trend samples: 7, 14, 21, and 28 days

To compare the optimization periods without a moving endpoint, I used the
Metrics dashboard custom range with the same end timestamp for every sample:
**2026-08-09 07:05:21 UTC**. These are cumulative windows, not independent
weeks.

#### Organization totals

| Window ending at fixed timestamp | Requests | CPU | Outbound | KV reads | KV writes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 7 days | 256,201 | 8.5 h | 83.4 GiB | 3,055,011 | 601,698 |
| 14 days | 460,757 | 15.4 h | 146.3 GiB | 4,765,195 | 959,034 |
| 21 days | 570,660 | 18.7 h | 164.1 GiB | 7,233,992 | 1,357,736 |
| 28 days | 621,356 | 19.8 h | 164.6 GiB | 7,238,694 | 1,359,554 |

#### `ai-ubq-fi` overlay

| Window ending at fixed timestamp | Requests | CPU | Outbound | KV reads | KV writes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 7 days | 210,866 | 6.0 h | 82.3 GiB | 2,997,685 | 598,888 |
| 14 days | 356,658 | 10.4 h | 144.3 GiB | 4,686,969 | 953,685 |
| 21 days | 405,100 | 12.3 h | 161.4 GiB | 7,141,771 | 1,346,655 |
| 28 days | 413,992 | 12.3 h | 161.4 GiB | 7,146,473 | 1,348,473 |

#### Non-overlapping weekly deltas

Subtracting adjacent cumulative windows gives this approximate sequence, with
the newest week first:

| Relative week | Org requests | Org outbound | Org KV reads/writes | `ai-ubq-fi` requests | `ai-ubq-fi` outbound | `ai-ubq-fi` KV reads/writes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Days 0–7 | 256,201 | 83.4 GiB | 3,055,011 / 601,698 | 210,866 | 82.3 GiB | 2,997,685 / 598,888 |
| Days 8–14 | 204,556 | 62.9 GiB | 1,710,184 / 357,336 | 145,792 | 62.0 GiB | 1,689,284 / 354,797 |
| Days 15–21 | 109,903 | 17.8 GiB | 2,468,797 / 398,702 | 48,442 | 17.1 GiB | 2,454,802 / 392,970 |
| Days 22–28 | 50,696 | 0.5 GiB | 4,702 / 1,818 | 8,892 | <0.1 GiB | 4,702 / 1,818 |

CPU deltas over those rows were 8.5 h, 6.9 h, 3.3 h, and 1.1 h for the
organization; `ai-ubq-fi` was 6.0 h, 4.4 h, 1.9 h, and under 0.1 h (rounded) in
the same order. The newest week is therefore the dominant workload, while the
oldest week is nearly idle. The high KV count in days 15–21 despite fewer
requests suggests background/reconciliation or retry activity; the dashboard
does not identify its route, so it should not be attributed to a code change
without a route-level export.

At the 28-day average, a 30-day linear projection is approximately 666k
organization requests, 21.2 CPU hours, 176 GiB outbound, 7.76M KV reads, and
1.46M KV writes. The corresponding `ai-ubq-fi` projection is approximately
444k requests, 13.2 CPU hours, 173 GiB outbound, 7.66M KV reads, and 1.44M KV
writes. Even this calmer four-week average remains incompatible with Free for
CPU (organization-wide), outbound traffic, KV reads, and KV writes.

For the organization-wide projection, the distance from Free is:

| Metric | 30-day projection | Free limit | Projected difference | Multiple of Free |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HTTP requests | 666k | 1M | 334k under | 0.67× |
| CPU time | 21.2 h | 15 h | 6.2 h over | 1.41× |
| Outbound traffic | 176 GiB | 20 GB | about 156 GiB over* | about 8.8× |
| KV reads | 7.76M | 450k | 7.31M over | 17.2× |
| KV writes | 1.46M | 300k | 1.16M over | 4.9× |

\*The console reports GiB while the published Free allowance is expressed as
GB, so the outbound difference is intentionally rounded.

At the same projected 666k requests/month, the average resource budget would
need to look like this:

| Resource | Current 28-day average | Free budget at 666k requests | Required reduction |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Outbound traffic | about 277 KiB/request | about 29 KiB/request | 89% |
| KV reads | 11.65/request | 0.68/request | 94% |
| KV writes | 2.19/request | 0.45/request | 79% |
| CPU time | 115 ms/request | 81 ms/request | 29% |

This is the practical feasibility boundary. CPU reduction is plausible through
normal engineering work, and four inactive apps could be removed to meet the
app cap. The outbound and KV targets are architectural: they require roughly
9× less outbound/request traffic and 14–17× fewer KV reads than the current
production profile, plus a substantially cheaper durable-accounting path.

### Special-key path

The repository already has a special allowlist path; a new bypass is not needed
just to test the idea:

| Credential path | Handler auth kind | V3 API-key ledger? | Assessment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UOS_AI_TOKEN` | `auth_tokens_allowlist` | No | Can avoid the API-key reservation/dispatch ledger, but is a shared bearer with no per-project quota. |
| `/admin/api-keys` key, even with an unlimited limit | `kv_api_key` | **Yes** | The V3 ledger still records unlimited keys; an unlimited setting does not make this path KV-free. |
| `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` | `admin_allowlist` / `deno_deploy_token` | No | Must remain an administrative credential; do not use it as a project data-plane key. |

An allowlist key would remove a large part of the V3 KV overhead and could make
the read side close to the Free budget in warm isolates. It would not make the
request free: successful responses still run prompt-cache telemetry, and Codex
routing, model/configuration, retries, and background jobs still use KV. To fit
the write budget, telemetry would likely need sampling or a separate trusted
policy. This path is therefore a credible KV optimization, but it does not
solve outbound egress. It also removes per-project accounting and makes one
leaked shared secret a system-wide incident.

### Official Codex client and outbound payloads

The gateway accepts the official Responses `context_management` parameter and
forwards it upstream, but it still receives and serializes the complete client
`input` array before the upstream POST. Prompt-cache hits reduce upstream model
work; they do not remove those bytes from the Deno-to-Codex egress path. The
gateway currently accepts `previous_response_id` in its schema but does not
forward it as a stateful conversation reference.

Therefore, if preserving the official Codex client semantics is a hard
requirement, an 89% egress reduction cannot come from silently dropping or
rewriting old turns in the gateway. It would require a validated upstream
transport/protocol change, client-side compaction that is actually reflected in
the submitted input, or materially lower production context sizes. This is the
strongest Free-tier constraint.

## Optimization timeline and normalized efficiency

The relevant commits are:

- `206f793` — **2026-07-22 15:37 EDT**, `fix: cut inference KV traffic`.
  This added the 30-second API-key policy cache, replaced the old success-only
  counter path with a V2 atomic `sum`, removed the old per-request dual-record
  API-key usage update, and added Codex auth/rate-limit caching. Its budget tests
  explicitly expected warm unlimited inference to perform zero KV operations
  and warm bounded inference to perform one read plus one atomic sum.
- `a01fc61`, `ef003be`, and `1ebcb31` — follow-up review fixes on Jul 22;
  `2628c23` — **2026-07-23 03:47 EDT**, `fix: eliminate inference-path KV
  exhaustion`, completing the migration-window hardening.
- `a6d25e2` and `a8d1054` — **2026-07-23 23:16–23:22 EDT**, decoupling boot
  from reconciliation and making KV initialization lazy. These mainly reduce
  cold-start/background work.
- `b63990e` — **2026-07-27 05:06 EDT**, `feat: replace API-key quota
  accounting with V3 ledger`. This is a correctness/accounting rewrite, not a
  pure optimization: a normal successful API-key inference now performs a
  policy read, window/request reads, a reservation CAS, dispatch reads, a
  dispatch CAS, and completion reads. In the current code that is at least
  seven strong `get` calls and two atomic commits writing four ledger records,
  before optional prompt-cache telemetry and retry/background work.
- Jul 27–28 prompt-cache telemetry commits (`fdfcb38`, `cf351d3`, `6eea2e5`,
  `94aeb70`, `a33dbe8`, `37a3b14`, `7c16025`, `19f5548`, `80a1f7b`,
  `9aa1746`) added diagnostic and capability counters. They are observability
  work and can add one or more writes per successful request.
- `c1bd41e` — **2026-07-29 15:39 EDT**, `perf(gateway): fast-path unlimited
  Cerebras requests`; this is limited to Cerebras and does not materially
  change the dominant Codex path.

The live Metrics dashboard supplied two same-app comparison pairs (read at
07:29–07:33 UTC on Aug 9). These are useful diagnostics, not a controlled
experiment: request mix, provider, retry rate, background work, and deployment
timing differ between windows.

### V2 optimization window (`ai-ubq-fi`)

| Window (UTC) | Requests | KV reads | KV writes | Outbound | Reads/request | Writes/request | Outbound/request |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Jul 20 00:00 → Jul 22 19:30 (before `206f793`) | 22,038 | 449,135 | 157,050 | 11.1 GiB | 20.38 | 7.13 | 527 KiB |
| Jul 23 12:00 → Jul 26 07:30 (after V2 hardening, before V3) | 18,902 | 445,043 | 128,621 | 4.6 GiB | 23.54 | 6.80 | 257 KiB |

Outbound per request fell by about half and writes fell slightly in this pair,
while reads rose. The large egress change is consistent with a different
request/input mix, so it is supporting evidence rather than causal proof of
`206f793`.

### V3 ledger window (`ai-ubq-fi`)

| Window (UTC) | Requests | KV reads | KV writes | Outbound | Reads/request | Writes/request | Outbound/request |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Jul 25 00:00 → Jul 27 08:00 (before `b63990e`) | 35,892 | 221,805 | 47,731 | 10.7 GiB | 6.18 | 1.33 | 313 KiB |
| Jul 27 12:00 → Jul 29 20:00 (after V3 and telemetry) | 64,200 | 661,728 | 160,353 | 28.6 GiB | 10.31 | 2.50 | 467 KiB |

This second pair shows the expected direction for the V3 accounting change:
roughly 1.7× more reads and 1.9× more writes per request. It does not mean
the ledger is wrong; it means the durable reservation/dispatch invariant has a
real KV cost that must be included in any Free-tier plan.

The fixed-end weekly samples tell the same volume story. `ai-ubq-fi` averaged
about 6.9k requests/day in days 15–21, 20.8k/day in days 8–14, and 30.1k/day
in the newest days 0–7. Its KV rates were approximately 50.7/8.1,
11.6/2.4, and 14.2/2.8 reads/writes per request, respectively. The newest
week is therefore heavier mainly because the system was used 3–4× more; the
days 15–21 bucket also straddles the Jul 22–27 migrations and contains
background/retry activity, so it must not be read as a clean regression test.

## Continued read-only exploration

### The four apps above the Free app cap

The second page of the organization Applications view (`Showing 21–24 of
24`) contains:

| App | Console state |
| --- | --- |
| `audit-ubq-fi` | Last updated 3 months ago; no recent requests |
| `uusd-ubq-fi` | Last updated 3 months ago; no recent requests |
| `uusd-ubq-fi-deno2` | Last updated 3 months ago; no recent requests |
| `uusd-ubq-fi-canary` | Not deployed yet |

These are candidates for an owner decision about cleanup, but no app was
deleted or disabled during this audit.

### What is driving egress

The application Logs view was sampled over the one-hour range around 06:54 UTC.
The console returned 12 terminal records in that view; this is a bounded UI
sample, not a complete export of all requests. All sampled records were
`responses` SSE requests with HTTP 200. Input/output telemetry was:

- input tokens: 26,722–220,739 (median 89,483; 1,399,607 total);
- output tokens: 39–1,247 (median 138; 2,710 total);
- output tokens were only 0.194% of input tokens in this sample.

The gateway serializes the complete request body and sends it to the Codex
upstream (`JSON.stringify(body)` and a `fetch` POST in
[`src/codex.ts`](../src/codex.ts#L1579)). The request body includes the full
`input` array and `stream: true` ([`src/codex.ts`](../src/codex.ts#L2692)).
Deno defines the Free bandwidth allowance as egress across deployments and
excludes inbound request data. Therefore the approximately 409 KiB of
outbound traffic per request is **strongly consistent with large upstream
request bodies (plus the streamed response and protocol overhead)**, rather
than with the small generated output alone. A direct per-request byte split is
not available in the current terminal log schema, so this is an attribution
hypothesis supported by the code and token telemetry, not a byte-level proof.

### KV accounting boundary

For the normal API-key inference path, the code shows several separate KV
stages: authentication reads the key policy; admission strongly reads the
policy, window, and request records and commits the reservation; provider
dispatch reads the request/window records and commits the dispatched state; and
completion releases/settles the reservation. Terminal prompt-cache telemetry
then performs an atomic counter commit per successful completion. Same-isolate
routing and capacity state are cached for 5 seconds, and the Codex auth pool is
cached for 5 minutes, so those control-plane reads are not intended to occur on
every request.

The observed seven-day average (14.25 KV reads and 2.83 KV writes per
`ai-ubq-fi` request) is compatible with this combination of quota CAS,
telemetry, retries, cold isolates, and background jobs. The next optimization
question is not whether to remove quota correctness, but whether optional
telemetry and redundant/retry reads can be reduced without weakening the
admission and settlement invariants.

As a separate scope check, the `ai-ubq-fi` production Metrics view showed
2,703 requests, 4.2 CPU minutes, 1.2 GiB incoming, 1.2 GiB outgoing, 27,922 KV
reads, and 10,524 KV writes in its last-hour range around 07:00 UTC. That is
about 455 KiB outgoing/request, 10.3 reads/request, and 3.9 writes/request.
This production-only view does not match the organization-wide app overlay
because the latter includes organization/app activity across its selected
scope. The organization-wide values remain the correct basis for Free-plan
limits; the production view is useful only as a corroborating traffic sample.

### Historical low-activity baseline

Subtracting the last-30-day totals from the last-90-day totals leaves a rough
60-day low-activity baseline of 108,613 requests, 4.6 CPU hours, 2.6 GiB
outbound, 16,517 KV reads, and 3,458 KV writes for the organization. Normalized
to 30 days, that is about 54k requests, 2.3 CPU hours, 1.3 GiB outbound, 8.3k
KV reads, and 1.7k KV writes per month. The subtraction is approximate because
the console rounds values and does not expose a matching historical memory-time
series here. The user has since confirmed that the newer, heavier activity is
real production usage, so this older low-activity period is not a valid reason
to expect a Free-tier fit.

The current production workload has already exceeded several Free limits, and
the organization still has 24 apps. A future Free-plan trial would require
materially reducing production resource use, a fresh full-cycle measurement
(including memory time), and an owner decision to bring active apps to 20 or
fewer.

## Code-level usage drivers

These are cost/accounting observations, not a recommendation to remove safety
or quota controls without a separate design review:

- [`serve.ts`](../serve.ts#L9) registers a KV-backed reconciliation cron every
  minute and a provider-capacity sampler every 15 minutes. These create a
  background floor even when request traffic is quiet.
- [`src/auth.ts`](../src/auth.ts#L665) resolves KV during client
  authentication. API-key requests then perform a strong policy read through
  `authenticateApiKeyToken` and continue into quota admission.
- [`src/api_key_policy.ts`](../src/api_key_policy.ts#L618) performs a strong
  policy read plus strong window/request reads for admission, followed by an
  atomic reservation commit (`#L708`). Dispatch and release paths perform
  additional reads/atomic commits. This is the main candidate for reducible
  per-request KV overhead, but any change must preserve idempotency and quota
  correctness.
- [`src/handler.ts`](../src/handler.ts#L188) logs terminal telemetry and calls
  `recordPromptCacheTelemetry` for completed requests. The telemetry gate uses
  an atomic KV counter commit per successful completion
  ([`src/prompt_cache_telemetry_gate.ts`](../src/prompt_cache_telemetry_gate.ts#L321)).
  This is an observability write, separate from the quota ledger.
- [`src/handler.ts`](../src/handler.ts#L265) forwards SSE response chunks from
  the provider without a compression layer. The response path can therefore
  add framing and output bytes, but the one-hour sample suggests that the much
  larger upstream request body is the dominant egress component. The metrics do
  not by themselves provide a per-request byte split.

## Raspberry Pi feasibility

This service is technically portable to ARM64 Linux because the runtime
entrypoint is a normal Deno `serve.ts` handler and local Deno KV is supported.
The earlier Pi 5 estimate below is hardware-conditional; it does not describe
the Raspberry Pi that is currently available.

### Live Pi preflight (2026-08-09 08:00 UTC)

The requested bounded SSH inspection was read-only. It found:

| Fact | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware | Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W Rev 1.0; 4 Cortex-A53 cores; aarch64 |
| Operating system | Debian GNU/Linux 12 (Bookworm); Linux 6.12.47+rpt-rpi-v8 |
| Memory | 464 MiB total; 160 MiB available during the check; 860 MiB swap, 602 MiB free |
| Runtime | Deno 2.9.2, Bun 1.1.21, Node 22.19.0 |
| Storage | 119.4 GB `mmcblk0` microSD root disk; 92 GB free; no SSD/NVMe |
| Current load | 0.20 (1-minute load); SoC temperature about 40.8 C |
| Existing public services | Two `cloudflared` tunnels, a Pi-local KV service, and other Pi tooling |
| Target checkout | `/home/pi/repos/ubiquity/ai.ubq.fi`, clean `development` branch, 14 commits behind `origin/development` |
| Target service | No `ai.ubq.fi` systemd service, listener, or scheduled job is installed |

The running `pi-agent-deno.service` is a separate application rooted at
`/home/pi/repos/0x4007/pi-agent`; the other Deno listener is the Ubiquity OS
kernel. Existing timers cover Pi telemetry and a Pi-agent KV backup only. The
Pi therefore is not currently serving this gateway, and its current idle
headroom is not a gateway capacity measurement.

The Zero 2 W is not a realistic production primary for the observed workload.
At roughly 0.35 requests/second and 1.2 Mbps average outbound traffic, its CPU
could plausibly serve a low-concurrency personal proxy, but the 464 MiB memory
budget leaves little room for a Deno gateway, large Codex input arrays, local KV
cache/database pages, two tunnels, and request concurrency. The system is
already using swap at idle, and the microSD-backed root disk is a poor target
for write-heavy local KV state. Large-body peaks and tail latency were not
measured, so an average-rate calculation cannot establish safe capacity.

The appropriate hardware floor for a serious self-hosting experiment is at
least a Pi 5 with 8 GB RAM, active cooling, and SSD/NVMe-backed local KV. Even
that would need a bounded load test, external backups, a reverse proxy or
tunnel, TLS/firewall rules, watchdog/restart policy, and an explicit
availability plan. It would move the current approximately 82 GiB/week of
egress to the home/office uplink and make the device a single point of failure.

The current Deploy-specific behavior is also incomplete on a Pi: the two
`Deno.cron` jobs are registered only when `config.isDeploy` is true. A Pi
deployment would need systemd timers or another scheduler for paid-fallback
reconciliation and provider-capacity sampling, plus a deliberate local-KV
backup and restore procedure.

The latest `ai-ubq-fi` week averaged about 0.35 requests/second, 1.2 Mbps of
outbound traffic, 3.6% of one CPU core by the dashboard's CPU-time measure,
about 5 KV reads/second, and about 1 KV write/second. A Pi 5 with 8 GB RAM,
active cooling, and an SSD/NVMe-backed local KV database should plausibly
handle that average gateway workload. Peak concurrency, large request bodies,
and memory-time were not measured here, so a Pi 4 or SD-card-only setup should
not be treated as production-capable without a load test.

Running on a Pi would not make the resource use disappear. The approximately
82 GiB/week of current outbound traffic would move to the home/office ISP or
the tunnel provider, and the Pi would become a single point of failure. Public
service would need a reverse proxy or Cloudflare/Tailscale tunnel, TLS,
firewalling, secret protection, SSD backups, a UPS, and systemd restart/watchdog
policy. Local KV would also lose Deno Deploy's managed durability and
multi-isolate availability. The Pi is realistic for a personal gateway or a
carefully operated primary with a standby, but it is not an equivalent
drop-in replacement for Deno Deploy's edge and availability model.

## Cheaper hosting options

Deno remains the best runtime fit for this codebase. The entrypoint is already
Deno/TypeScript, the upstream path uses standard `fetch` and Web Streams, and
the current tests and scripts are Deno-native. Deno Deploy is the best managed
fit, but it is not the lowest-cost host once the gateway is used heavily.

The official [Deno Deploy pricing page](https://deno.com/deploy/pricing/)
currently lists Pro at $20/month, with 200 GB egress, 1.3M KV reads, and 0.9M
KV writes included. Overage is $0.50/GB egress, $1/M reads, and $2.50/M
writes. Applying those rates to the existing 28-day organization projection
(666k requests, 176 GiB egress, 7.76M reads, 1.46M writes) gives an estimated
**$27.86/month** before taxes or unrelated usage. This is a rounded planning
estimate; the egress GiB-to-GB conversion can move it slightly.

The newest `ai-ubq-fi` week is much hotter than that smoothed average (about
82.3 GiB egress, 3.0M reads, and 0.6M writes). If that week repeats for a
month, Pro egress alone would exceed its included allowance, and the total is
roughly **$115–$125/month** depending on the unit conversion. This is why the
recent production pattern matters more than the quiet historical baseline.
This is a **stress-case run-rate**, not the current invoice forecast. In the
08:00 UTC snapshot, requests, CPU, memory time, egress, and writes were within
Pro allowances; only KV reads were over the included Pro amount. The displayed
$1.99 usage charge is consistent with approximately 2M read units over the
1.3M monthly allowance. The current-cycle expectation is therefore closer to
the $20 base plus a small KV overage unless the newest hot week continues.

| Host | Current public starting point | Fit for this gateway | Main trade-off |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| [Deno Deploy Pro](https://deno.com/deploy/pricing/) | $20/month plus usage | Drop-in managed edge, Deploy KV, logs, and scaling | Most operationally convenient; hot-week egress can make it expensive |
| [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/) | $10/month for 2 GB, 2 vCPUs, 60 GB SSD, 3 TB transfer (North America; 1 GB/$5 is too tight) | Strong low-cost first migration target; run Deno under systemd and local KV | You own patching, backups, TLS, monitoring, and availability |
| [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets) | $12/month for 2 GB, 1 vCPU, 50 GB SSD, 2,000 GiB transfer | Similar VPS path with simple tooling | More expensive than Lightsail at this size; still self-managed |
| [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) | Usually the lowest-cost VPS class, region/plan dependent | Good economics and generous transfer for a Deno VM | Check US-region availability and accept full operations responsibility |
| [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) | $5/month paid account minimum; no additional transfer charge | Potentially the cheapest managed egress path | Not a drop-in: replace Deno KV with D1/Durable Objects and replace `Deno.cron`; validate long SSE and strong ledger semantics |
| Current Pi Zero 2 W | No hosting fee | Development or low-concurrency standby only | 464 MiB RAM, swap pressure, microSD writes, home-network failure domain |

The practical recommendation is to keep the Deno code and, if the goal is
lower cash cost, move the same service to a **2 GB VPS**. Lightsail at $10 or a
similar Hetzner plan is likely materially cheaper than a hot Deno Deploy month
while retaining enough memory for large Codex request bodies. Use SSD-backed
local KV, systemd timers for the two Deploy cron jobs, Caddy or another
streaming-safe TLS proxy, off-host backups, and a rollback path. This saves
hosting money but transfers operations and availability risk to us.

Cloudflare Workers is worth a separate prototype only if eliminating egress
charges is more important than preserving the current storage implementation.
It would be an architectural migration, not an infrastructure-only move.

## Open questions for the next read-only pass

1. Confirm which of the 24 apps are intentionally retained; the four overflow
   apps and their current console states are recorded above. Deleting or
   disabling them requires explicit approval.
2. Separate unavoidable KV operations (authentication, quota reservation,
   dispatch/release) from optional telemetry and background reconciliation.
3. Obtain a bounded byte-level measurement for upstream request bodies versus
   streamed responses; terminal logs provide token counts but not byte counts.
4. Re-run the projection after any production optimization; evaluate Free only
   after the resource budgets are met for a full cycle and active apps are at
   most 20.
