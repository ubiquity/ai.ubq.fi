# The `ubiquity/deepseek-v4.1-flash` waterfall model — implementation plan

Decision: one synthetic model id that the gateway serves by walking the measured provider order on the client's behalf.
Agents keep addressing one id; the gateway owns provider choice, failover, and evidence.

## Identity and wire

- Model id: `ubiquity/deepseek-v4.1-flash`; display name: `Ubiquity DeepSeek V4.1 Flash`; description states the
  automatic provider fallback.
- Wire: `/v1/responses` only (the subagent wire). Chat Completions is out of scope for phase 1.
- Provider-specific ids stay unchanged: `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` (OpenRouter), `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`
  (LithosAI), `deepseek-flash` (official), `deepseek-v4.1-flash` (paid catalogue for Surplus and OpenLux). Operators
  keep the existing provider-selection pinning, so benchmark batches can still force a single provider.

## Order and semantics

Order: **LithosAI → DeepSeek direct → OpenRouter → Surplus → OpenLux** since the 2026-10-07 economy reorder
(docs/DECISIONS.md). Within the three direct hops the cheaper per-token routes lead: LithosAI Base and the DeepSeek
off-peak rate are $0.15/$0.60 per 1M input/output at list price, half of OpenRouter's $0.30/$1.20 for the same weights,
so OpenRouter drops from first to third. **Surplus** and **OpenLux** are the two paid hops, each pinned to its own paid
tier (`allowedPaidProviders`) so neither can silently advance to the other; the routing layer names OpenLux "metered".
The pre-reorder order was OpenRouter → LithosAI → DeepSeek → Surplus (phase 1/2).

Per request the gateway attempts each enabled provider in order and advances only on infrastructure/serving failures:

- transport/connect/DNS failure, request timeout, HTTP 429, HTTP 5xx, HTTP 402/403 quota or capacity. Phase 2 adds
  pre-semantic stream failures (malformed SSE, interrupted stream, missing completion before any output).
- Never advance on a client-caused 4xx validation response or on a valid-but-wrong answer.
- Once any semantic output has reached the client, failover stops: the gateway reports the failure and the client's
  retry restarts the chain at the top. The attempt-level integration that would cover mid-stream failover is phase 2.
- Each hop uses the existing bounded first-event deadline; the chain is bounded by the request deadline, and a hop is
  skipped when the request signal is already aborted.

## Evidence and observability

- Every attempted provider is recorded in the terminal `attempted_providers` list; the failing status or error class is
  retained for the chain, so production traffic keeps measuring the waterfall (objective section 12).
- The delivered response keeps `x-uos-upstream` = the provider that actually served, and the terminal log keeps the
  request identity.

## Capabilities and metadata

- Context window 1,048,576 tokens on every candidate; tools supported on every candidate.
- Advertised reasoning tiers are the intersection the candidates all accept verbatim: `low`, `high`, `max`. The
  waterfall boundary rejects any other value for this id with a 400 instead of letting a provider refuse it later.
  (DeepSeek official also accepts `none`; Surplus/OpenRouter advertise only low/high/max, so `none` is not advertised.)
- The Codex-facing catalogue record mirrors the LithosAI record shape; the plain `/v1/models` list also carries the id.
- The public/admin catalogue's provider rows follow the order above: the gateway identity first, then one row per
  configured hop (lithos, deepseek, openrouter, surplus, openlux).

## Phases

- **Phase 1 (this change):** resolver + wrapper over the three direct handlers, catalogue record, reasoning validation,
  fallback telemetry, hermetic unit tests, and a live smoke of every hop through provider-selection pinning.
- **Phase 2:** Surplus as the final hop through the paid pipeline (admission, reservation, ledger settlement must not be
  bypassed), and pre-semantic mid-stream failover by integrating with the attempt primitives (`prepareResponsesAttempt`
  and the precommit buffering the paid route already uses) instead of handler-level wrapping.
- **Phase 3 (optional):** explicit per-provider pin ids for experiments; not needed for production.
- **Phase 4 (shipped 2026-10-07):** the economy reorder above, the OpenLux responses hop wired to its `/v1/responses`
  endpoint as the last resort, and the paid-hop pin fix that threads `allowedPaidProviders` from the waterfall through
  the ordinary paid pipeline.

## Rollback

Remove the catalogue record, the dispatch branch, and the waterfall module. Provider-specific ids, paid-tier routing,
and the Codex waterfall are untouched by construction.

## Acceptance

- Hermetic tests: order resolution with disabled providers, failover on 5xx/429/402/403, no failover on 400, rejection
  of unadvertised reasoning tiers, catalog record shape.
- Live smoke (local benchmark instance, provider selection pinned per hop): default selection serves via OpenRouter;
  pinning to `["lithos"]` / `["deepseek"]` serves via those providers through the synthetic id; the terminal log records
  the served provider.
- Repository gate: `sh scripts/verify.sh` plus the CI checks on the pull request.

## Phase 2 implementation notes (scoped 2026-10-06)

Phase 1 shipped as PR #938 (merged `05f59243`). Phase 2 executes with these concrete mechanisms:

1. **Surplus hop through the ordinary pipeline tail.**
   - Export the tail of `handleResponsesInternal` (`prepareResponsesRequest` → `runResponsesFailover` →
     `buildResponsesDelivery` → `deliverPreparedResponses`) from `src/responses-handler.ts` as one function and call it
     from both the ordinary router and the waterfall, so nothing is duplicated.
   - The waterfall handler keeps `rawBody` (its dispatch branch gains the argument) and, for the final hop, builds a
     fresh `Request` whose body is `{...rawBody, model: "deepseek-v4.1-flash"}` and calls that tail. Admission,
     reservation and ledger settlement stay exactly the paid path's.
   - `fetchResponsesWithPaidFallback` gains an optional `allowedPaidProviders` filter (default unchanged) so this hop
     pins `["surplus"]` and can never silently advance to metered/OpenLux.
   - The hop's success/failure is the tail's response status; it is last, so nothing advances past it.

2. **Pre-semantic mid-stream failover.**
   - Gate every 200 streaming hop response on the first semantic commitment using the paid route's own helpers:
     `readResponsesStream`, `responsesEventSemanticKind`, `appendResponsesPrecommitEvent` (bounds
     `MAX_RESPONSES_PRECOMMIT_EVENTS` / `MAX_RESPONSES_PRECOMMIT_CHARS`) and replay through
     `createOwnedResponsesStream`.
   - A parse error, premature EOF, malformed frame or missing terminal observed before any text or tool-call event is a
     failed hop: discard its buffer and continue the chain. Once semantic output exists, deliver the replayed stream and
     stop failing over.
   - The pre-commit phase stays bounded by the existing first-event and semantic deadlines; a hop that stalls before
     commitment fails like a timeout.

3. **Tests for phase 2.**
   - Injected dispatchers over synthetic SSE streams: dropped before first output advances the chain; dropped after
     first output does not; the surplus hop receives the paid model id and delegates to the tail stub.
   - Paid-routing unit coverage: `allowedPaidProviders: ["surplus"]` never selects metered, including on surplus
     capacity failure; the absent filter preserves today's behavior byte-for-byte.
   - Live: four-hop smoke (each direct hop pinned through the operator selection plus the surplus hop) and one forced
     pre-output stream failure against the scratch instance.

4. **Docs.** Update the benchmark report and this plan with the phase-2 evidence and the final waterfall semantics.

## Phase 2 status (implemented 2026-10-06)

All four hops are live behind the synthetic id on a scratch instance of this revision:

- selection `["openrouter"]` / `["lithos"]` / `["deepseek"]` served 200 with `x-uos-upstream` equal to the pinned
  provider;
- selection `["surplus"]` served 200 with `x-uos-upstream: surplus`, and the paid ledger settled it (surplus
  `spend_microcredits` 291478 -> 291526, request count 35 -> 36), so admission, reservation and ledger settlement were
  not bypassed;
- `x-uos-attempted-providers` reports the chain on every response.

Implementation deltas from the scoped notes, kept truthful:

- The streaming gate replays the buffered pre-commit bytes and then forwards the hop handler's own response stream
  verbatim, instead of rebuilding the stream through `createOwnedResponsesStream`. That preserves each handler's own
  delivery machinery (keepalive, terminal synthesis, telemetry), which the gap analysis showed matters more than
  sequence rewriting; the gate itself still uses `readResponsesStream` + `prepareResponsesStreamForCommit`.
- Simulated infrastructure failures were validated live with a fault-injecting instance of this revision (the process
  intercepts only OpenRouter's completion endpoints; everything else passes through to the real network and the real
  handler stack serves the request): with the operator selection pinned to `["openrouter","deepseek"]`, an injected 503
  on the first hop produced HTTP 200 from DeepSeek with `x-uos-attempted-providers: openrouter,deepseek` and terminal
  `fallback_reason: deepseek_waterfall:openrouter:503`; an injected stream that sent only `response.created` before
  closing produced the same advancement through the pre-output stream-death path. Hermetic tests additionally cover
  stream death after output (delivered, no further provider spent) and transport failure.

## Phase 4 status (implemented 2026-10-07)

The cost-first economy order ships behind the same synthetic id:

- order `["lithos","deepseek","openrouter","surplus","openlux"]`; the plan drops switched-off and uncredentialed hops
  without reordering the rest;
- the Surplus hop's paid tail receives `allowedPaidProviders: ["surplus"]` and the OpenLux hop's receives `["metered"]`
  (the routing layer's name for OpenLux), threaded end-to-end from the waterfall through `runOrdinaryResponsesTail` to
  `fetchResponsesWithPaidFallback`; every other caller keeps the default Surplus -> Metered paid order;
- OpenLux serves the Responses wire through the existing `fetchMeteredResponses` transport
  (`https://api.openlux.ai/v1/responses`), so the last hop is wired rather than merely advertised;
- hermetic coverage: order/plan assertions, both paid-hop pin assertions, and a last-hop failover test where every prior
  paid hop fails and OpenLux serves, pinned to metered.
