/**
 * LithosAI API transport — a chat-completions-only upstream provider.
 *
 * Like Cerebras and DeepSeek this is a "special upstream provider": a request
 * addressed to one of its model ids is dispatched straight to the provider's
 * documented OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint and never races or
 * falls back to another provider. A rate-limit refusal (429) load-balances that
 * single request once onto the tier's configured sibling - the same weights
 * behind a separate per-model bucket - and otherwise relays the vendor's own
 * refusal; where `LITHOSAI_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT` is set, a refusal that names a
 * window inside a bounded budget is waited out and retried on the SAME model id
 * instead (`src/provider/lithos-rate-limits.ts`). Neither path ever substitutes
 * another provider or model.
 *
 * Provider facts (probed live against `https://api.lithosai.cloud/v1`,
 * 2026-09-23):
 * - base URL `https://api.lithosai.cloud/v1`, Chat Completions at
 *   `/chat/completions`. There is NO `/v1/responses` endpoint (probed: 404 with
 *   an empty body), so this provider is chat-only and can never serve the
 *   Responses route.
 * - auth is `Authorization: Bearer $LITHOSAI_API_KEY`; keys are prefixed
 *   `lith_sk_`.
 * - `GET /v1/models` returned exactly the eight ids in `LITHOS_MODEL_IDS`,
 *   carrying only `id`/`object`/`created`/`owned_by` — no context, capability or
 *   price metadata. Every one of the eight answered HTTP 200 on 2026-09-23.
 * - the context window is 1,048,576 tokens for all eight.
 * - `reasoning_effort` accepted exactly none/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh/max
 *   (each probed at HTTP 200 by varying only that field; `ultra`, `bogus` and
 *   the empty string were refused with 400). They are sent VERBATIM: no wire
 *   map is applied, and the provider's own default for an omitted effort was
 *   not probed.
 * - Kimi K3 requires `n: 1`, `presence_penalty: 0.0` and
 *   `frequency_penalty: 0.0`; `top_k` is accepted as a non-standard parameter.
 *
 * Observed wire behavior (2026-09-23 probes):
 * - a buffered success carries `message.reasoning_content` beside `content`,
 *   present and `null` when the model produced no reasoning, and
 *   `message.tool_calls`, present and `null` when there were no calls.
 *   `prompt_tokens_details` is likewise present and `null`, while
 *   `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` is a real integer.
 * - streaming frames are `data: {...}` lines terminated by `data: [DONE]`, and
 *   usage is reported UNCONDITIONALLY rather than behind
 *   `stream_options.include_usage`. The authoritative totals arrive on a
 *   trailing chunk whose `choices` is an EMPTY ARRAY, which is why the chunk
 *   normalizer below accepts one.
 * - tool-call ids look like `name:index`; they are opaque strings on this wire
 *   and are relayed unchanged.
 * - every admitted response and every refusal carries the six `x-ratelimit-*`
 *   headers in `LITHOS_RATE_LIMIT_HEADERS`, and there is no provider
 *   request-id header at all.
 * - the error envelope is not uniform: auth/validation/model failures use
 *   `{"error":{...}}`, while an engine parameter violation uses
 *   `{"object":"error","message":...,"type":"BadRequestError","code":400}` with
 *   an INTEGER `code`. No single reader may assume one shape.
