/**
 * Cross-machine Codex credential repair.
 *
 * The Mac and the VPS keep independent KV auth pools that are seeded from the
 * same synchronized `~/.codex/auth.json`. Because each host refreshes its own
 * access token, one host can end up holding a token the other has already
 * rotated away; the host left behind starts answering 401 until a human
 * re-uploads a credential. This module plans a narrow repair: keep every
 * account that still authenticates, and for an account that does not, adopt a
 * credential read from another host only after that credential has itself been
 * proven to authenticate.
 *
 * Validation is deliberately read-only. It is an account-bound `GET` against
 * the Codex usage endpoint, so it never runs inference and never reaches the
 * OAuth token endpoint, which means a check can never rotate a shared refresh
 * token and can never invalidate the other host's copy.
