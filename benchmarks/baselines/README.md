# Baseline adapters (m03)

Worker `m03-baseline-adapters-de0bd1341f`. Deterministic **fake-transport** baselines for the benchmark foundation
(m02): the runner still refuses every one of them (`requiresExternalInference: true`), and all traffic goes through an
injected transport, so focused tests stay hermetic and offline.

## Adapters

| id | adapter                 | behavior                                                               | default instance                                  |
| -- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| A  | `gateway-gpt-oss-chat`  | current gateway GPT-OSS Chat Completions behavior (m01 generic style)  | live gateway transport (`gpt-oss-120b`), refused  |
| B  | `codex-infinity-bridge` | codex-infinity-compatible process/trajectory bridge, pinned provenance | inert: never clones, never spawns                 |
| D  | `strong-control`        | generic strong control over an owner-approved OpenAI-compatible model  | placeholder model, null transport, always refused |

All implement `BenchmarkAdapter` from `benchmarks/adapter.ts` (schema 1.0) and write schema-valid events through
`AdapterRunContext.record`. The runner derives metrics, runs verification and evaluates oracles exactly as for the
`reference` adapter; a baseline run is successful only when the declared verification and oracle pass.

## Running the focused tests

From the repository root (the test suite runs disposable workspaces and the declared verification commands, so the same
permissions as the m02 test task are needed):

```sh
deno test --allow-read --allow-write=benchmark-runs --allow-run=sh,git benchmarks/baselines/tests
```

The adapters live in `baselineAdapters()`, deliberately **outside** `defaultAdapters()` (owned by m02).
`deno task benchmark:run --configs=A` therefore reports the config as unknown until the orchestrator wires the registry
into the shared runner; the in-repo refusal property is asserted by `registry.test.ts`
(`runBenchmarks(..., adapters: baselineAdapters())` throws the external-inference refusal).

## Provisioning (never performed by the adapter)

- **A**: no setup; uses the existing `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` at request time, exactly like the gateway.
- **B**: checkout the pinned revision manually and point
  `createBaselineB({ driver: "live", config: { checkoutPath, allowLiveProcess: true } })` at it, or install the pinned
  npm package. The adapter verifies the pinned ref, then spawns the process. The `codex-infinity` JSONL output schema is
  **not verified yet** — see the research report.
- **D**: attach an approved model plus an explicitly supplied transport. No new secrets or env interfaces are introduced
  by this module.

Primary source URLs, provenance and every fact that needs later live verification are recorded in
[docs/research/cerebras-agent-baselines.md](../../docs/research/cerebras-agent-baselines.md).
