# ai.ubq.fi

OpenAI API-compatible gateway for the ubq.fi ecosystem (Deno Deploy).

Autonomous agents should start at `https://ai.ubq.fi/llms.txt`. The machine-readable API contract is served at
`https://ai.ubq.fi/openapi.json`, and the complete integration guide is served at `https://ai.ubq.fi/llms-full.txt` from
[`static/docs/llms-agents.md`](static/docs/llms-agents.md).

## Development hooks

Enable the repository pre-commit hook once per checkout:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook automatically formats and applies safe lint fixes to staged files, then checks the gateway-owned source tree,
lint, build, and deterministic repository test program. It does not rewrite the pinned `lib/codex` checkout or run the
external Metered stress test; run `deno task test:stress` only when an explicitly approved local load test is required.

## How auth works

- Clients authenticate to `ai.ubq.fi` with a **UOS gateway token**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
  - Accepted tokens come from `UOS_AI_TOKEN` and/or API keys stored in Deno KV (created via `/admin/api-keys`).
  - Admin tokens (including Deno Deploy tokens) also grant access to client routes (`/v1/*`).
- The gateway **does not use or forward your client token upstream**.
  - For upstream requests, it uses a durable pool of up to two **Codex CLI ChatGPT auth** accounts. The first local seed
    can come from `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` (base64 of `~/.codex/auth.json`); admin uploads populate the durable pool.
  - Requests are distributed between the configured OpenAI accounts. An account-level `401` or `429` is retried on every
    other account before the gateway returns the error or considers paid metered fallback. Rejected OAuth refresh
    credentials count as an account-level `401`; transient refresh-network failures do not.
  - Upstream usage/limits are tied to those OpenAI accounts and plans; client-provided OpenAI API keys are ignored.
  - The OAuth `client_id` used for refresh-token rotation is **public** (not a secret); the secrets are the tokens in
    `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` and your client/admin tokens.

If a server-side Codex access or refresh token expires, `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions` return the
`x-uos-warning: codex_auth_reauthentication_required` header and an actionable message instead of silently presenting
the failure as a quota problem. A refresh rejection is returned as `503`; an upstream quota-shaped `403` can retain that
status when the access token is expired. Upload a fresh `auth.json` through the admin flow and retry. When the response
error code is `refresh_token_reused`, the configured refresh token was already consumed and a new sign-in or fresh
`auth.json` is required.

## Quickstart (curl)

Set a gateway token:

```bash
export UOS_AI_TOKEN="..."
```

Create one (admin):

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/admin/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"name":"example key","expires_at_ms":-1}' \
  | jq -r .token
```

Health:

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/health  # public release liveness only
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/health/providers -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN"
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/health/upstream -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN"
```

List models:

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN"
```

Codex clients request their native catalog for an exact installed version:

```bash
curl -sS 'https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/models?client_version=0.144.3' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN"
```

The unversioned response remains the strict OpenAI `{ "object": "list", "data": [...] }` contract. Supplying one exact
`X.Y.Z` `client_version` switches to the separate Codex compatibility contract and returns Codex's rich upstream
`{ "models": [...] }` payload without reducing its model records to OpenAI list objects. The gateway fetches this JSON
with server-held Codex authentication, caches each version independently in Deno KV for five minutes, and can serve its
last valid copy for up to 24 hours during a temporary upstream failure. It forwards the upstream `ETag` and honors
`If-None-Match`; client bearer tokens, cookies, and upstream credentials are never mixed or exposed.

Inspect gateway-specific model capabilities:

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/models/capabilities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN"
```

Use this endpoint, not `/v1/models`, when clients need gateway-specific fields such as reasoning support or token-window
limits (`context_window_tokens`, `max_context_window_tokens`, and `auto_compact_token_limit_tokens`). `/v1/models` keeps
the strict OpenAI model-object shape.

Whoami (debug which auth method was used; never returns raw secrets):

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/auth \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  | jq
```

Chat completion (OpenAI-compatible):

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "reasoning_effort": "high",
    "messages": [{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Tell me a short joke."}],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

Just the assistant message text:

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Tell me a short joke."}],"stream":false}' \
  | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'
```

Notes:

- System/developer messages are optional. When present, the gateway combines them into upstream instructions.
- The Codex upstream requires `stream: true`; when you set `"stream": false`, the gateway buffers the upstream stream
  and returns a normal JSON response.
- Chat completions and responses allow omitting `model`; the gateway falls back to its configured default.
- Use `reasoning_effort` for chat completions or `reasoning` for responses to control reasoning level.

Streaming:

```bash
curl -N https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant."},{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in 5 different ways."}]
  }'
```

Responses (OpenAI-compatible):

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "reasoning": { "effort": "high" },
    "instructions": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "input": "Summarize this in 1 sentence: ..."
  }'
```

## Codex quota reporting

Successful inference responses let unmodified Codex terminal and GUI clients show the Metered wallet in `/status` and
emit their built-in 25%, 10%, and 5% remaining warnings. The gateway publishes the wallet as the sole canonical family:
`x-codex-limit-name: Metered balance` and `x-codex-primary-used-percent`.

Codex 0.144.6 parses multiple response-header families but persists only one response-derived rate-limit snapshot, so
named OpenAI and Metered families overwrite one another instead of remaining independent. AI.UBQ therefore strips every
parseable upstream quota family and prioritizes the client-relevant Metered balance. It does not combine that percentage
with the shared ChatGPT subscription percentage: OpenAI does not provide an absolute token denominator, and the shared
account is not an individual AI.UBQ client's truthful capacity.

Metered does not publish a weekly allowance, so the gateway never fabricates a window or reset time. A Codex client
receives the update after its first inference response; opening `/status` before sending a message can therefore show
`Limits: data not available yet`. If no valid Metered snapshot is available, the gateway emits no quota percentage.

Quota monitoring uses the non-billable OpenLux `GET /api/usage/token/` endpoint with the existing `METERED_API_KEY`
(`Authorization: Bearer ...`). It does not send `New-Api-User` or make inference requests. The reported token totals are
cached in Deno KV for five minutes, guarded by a durable refresh lease, retained for 24 hours, and served stale during
temporary Metered failures. Signed `total_available` and `total_granted` values are kept as token usage data and are
never converted into refill-cycle credits. When `unlimited_quota` is true, the admin diagnostics show Unlimited, total
usage, and the observation time instead of a fabricated balance or reset window.

Embeddings (UOS text contract):

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model":"voyage-4-large",
    "input":["hello","world"],
    "input_type":"document",
    "dimensions":1024,
    "encoding_format":"float",
    "truncation":true
  }'
```

`POST /uos/embeddings` is a UOS endpoint backed by Voyage and cached in Deno KV. It accepts text strings only, so it is
not presented as a fully OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint: OpenAI's endpoint also accepts token arrays, while
Voyage's text API does not. The response remains the familiar OpenAI-style `{object:"list", data, model, usage}` shape.

Request fields:

- `model` (required): `voyage-4-large`.
- `input` (required): one string or an array of strings. Token arrays are rejected.
- `input_type` (optional): `query` or `document`; defaults to `document`. Send it explicitly for retrieval workloads.
- `dimensions` (optional): `256`, `512`, `1024` (default), or `2048`.
- `encoding_format` (optional): `float` (default) or `base64`.
- `truncation` (optional boolean): defaults to `true`.
- `user` (optional string or `null`): accepted and ignored.
- `Idempotency-Key` (optional request header): enables the UOS durable replay contract.

The gateway sends Voyage `output_dimension` and `output_dtype="float"`; `base64` conversion happens in the gateway. When
rate limited (by Voyage or the gateway's own KV throttling), it returns `429` with `Retry-After`. See the
[Voyage embeddings documentation](https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings).

### Migration from the removed embeddings route

`POST /v1/embeddings` has been removed. Existing text clients must change both the URL and model:

```text
old (removed): POST https://ai.ubq.fi/v1/embeddings  model: text-embedding-3-small|text-embedding-3-large
new:           POST https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/embeddings model: voyage-4-large
```

The former text defaults are preserved: `input_type` defaults to `document`, dimensions default to `1024`,
`encoding_format` defaults to `float`, and truncation defaults to `true`. OpenAI embedding model names are not accepted
or mapped to Voyage; the response shape remains stable. Set `input_type` explicitly before migrating if query/document
intent matters.

Embeddings jobs (async, gateway-specific):

Use this when you might exceed Voyage's free-tier rate limits. The gateway will either return the embeddings immediately
or queue the request and let you poll for completion.

Create:

```bash
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/embedding-jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"model":"voyage-4-large","input":["hello","world"],"input_type":"document","dimensions":1024,"truncation":false,"encoding_format":"float"}' \
  | jq
```

Poll:

```bash
job_id="$(curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/embedding-jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"model":"voyage-4-large","input":"hello","input_type":"query","dimensions":1024,"truncation":false,"encoding_format":"float"}' \
  | jq -r .id)"

curl -sS "https://ai.ubq.fi/uos/embedding-jobs/${job_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $UOS_AI_TOKEN" \
  | jq
```

Notes:

- Jobs intentionally retain their narrower profile: `model` must be exactly `voyage-4-large`, `input_type` is required,
  and `encoding_format` must be `float`.
- When queued, the gateway responds `202` with `Retry-After` and `retry_after_seconds`; poll until `status="succeeded"`.
- Jobs are scoped to the authenticated client identity; poll using credentials that resolve to the same identity scope
  used to create the job (same API key, or for GitHub/kernel auth the same `{owner, repo}` attestation context).
- Inputs are stored encrypted in Deno KV for up to 24h to allow deferred processing, and deleted once the job completes.

## CLI (ubq-ai)

Run from this repo:

```bash
# Run from an existing ai.ubq.fi checkout (the directory containing deno.json).
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
export UOS_AI_TOKEN="..."
deno task ubq-ai chat --system "You are a helpful assistant." "Tell me a short joke."
```

Client commands also accept an admin token (`DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN`) when `UOS_AI_TOKEN` is unset.

Install on your machine:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
deno install -g --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read -n ubq-ai scripts/ubq-ai.ts
```

Examples:

```bash
export UOS_AI_TOKEN="..."
ubq-ai whoami | jq
ubq-ai models | jq
ubq-ai chat --system "You are a helpful assistant." "Tell me a short joke."
ubq-ai chat --system "You are a helpful assistant." --reasoning-effort high "Solve: 24*7."
ubq-ai chat --system "You are a helpful assistant." --stream "Say hello in 5 different ways."
ubq-ai responses --instructions "You are a helpful assistant." "Summarize this in 1 sentence: ..."
ubq-ai responses --instructions "You are a helpful assistant." --reasoning-effort high "Write a short proof sketch for the pigeonhole principle."
```

Debug (prints useful env/token fingerprints to stderr, never raw secrets):

```bash
ubq-ai -v models
```

Health probe (cron-friendly):

```bash
# Public release liveness only:
deno task health:check --url https://ai.ubq.fi

# Operational diagnostics require admin authentication:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN" https://ai.ubq.fi/health/providers
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN" https://ai.ubq.fi/health/upstream
```

### Manual Deno Deploy usage monitoring and rollback record

This is an operator-run monitoring procedure. It does not add a gateway metric, an environment variable, a cron job, or
an automated alert. Use the Deno Deploy organization **Billing** and **Metrics** dashboards for usage data; the gateway
health endpoints report release identity and provider state, not billed Deno KV or egress use.

For the current billing cycle, create a manual warning record when any organization total reaches one of these
early-warning thresholds:

| Resource       | Warning threshold | Console handling                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Egress         |            150 GB | The console displays GiB. Treat 139 GiB displayed as a conservative warning; 140 GiB is already slightly more than 150 GB. |
| Deno KV reads  |              1.0M | Use the organization total, not a per-app value.                                                                           |
| Deno KV writes |              0.7M | Use the organization total, not a per-app value.                                                                           |

After every accepted production optimization, choose one UTC end timestamp and sample the same fixed-end custom ranges
for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Record both the organization total and the `ai-ubq-fi` overlay: the organization total is
the billing decision, while the overlay is only attribution. Preserve the dashboard's raw units and source time. Do not
compare GiB console values to GB allowances as though they were equal.

Keep these estimates separate in the observation record:

- Current-cycle Pro: the actual Billing dashboard value and current invoice context.
- Smoothed Pro: a 28-day fixed-end projection with its explicit rate and unit conversion.
- Hot-week Pro: a stress case only, not a forecast, unless the hot workload persists.
- Free feasibility: a separate pass/fail comparison against every Free limit; it is never proof that the next bill or a
  local test will fit Free.

Before and after a production change, record the observation UTC time, the full `release.git_sha` and
`release.deployment_id` from `/health`, and the matching `x-uos-git-sha` and `x-uos-deployment-id` headers. Cross-check
them against the deployment workflow's **Deployment attestation** summary. For each change, also record the prior
known-good SHA/deployment ID, a rollback trigger, the owner-approved revert target through the normal deployment
workflow, and the post-rollback `/health` identity. Do not delete KV data or use a health response as evidence of usage,
streaming, or billing acceptance. Append the filled record to
[the Deno usage audit](docs/deno-free-tier-audit-2026-08-09.md).

Admin examples (uses `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN`):

```bash
# Run Codex auth uploads from an existing ai.ubq.fi checkout (the repository root).
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN="..."
deno task upload:auth --url https://ai.ubq.fi --auth-json ~/.codex/auth.json
deno task upload:auth --url https://ai.ubq.fi --auth-json /secure/path/to/second-account-auth.json
ubq-ai admin keys create "example key"
ubq-ai admin keys create "tmp key" --expires week
ubq-ai admin keys list | jq
```

## Runtime env

- `CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64` (required for the initial seed): base64 of `~/.codex/auth.json` from a machine that ran
  `codex login`. It seeds one account; use the admin upload flow for the durable two-account pool.
- `UOS_AI_TOKEN` (optional): Comma- or newline-separated client tokens accepted via `Authorization: Bearer ...`. The
  gateway can also accept API keys stored in Deno KV (created via `/admin/api-keys`).
- `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` (optional, recommended): Tokens accepted for admin endpoints.
- `CODEX_BASE_URL` (optional): Defaults to `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`.
- `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` (optional): Server-side credential for explicit non-streaming Chat Completions requests to Cerebras
  `gpt-oss-120b`. It is never accepted from clients or exposed by health responses.
- `VOYAGEAI_API_KEY` (optional): Voyage API key used for embeddings. If unset, the gateway will look for a key stored in
  Deno KV at `["uos_ai","voyage_api_key"]`.
- `METERED_API_KEY` (optional): OpenLux business API key used only by the server for paid fallback and the non-billable
  token-usage quota snapshot. It is never sent to gateway clients.
- `SURPLUS_API_KEY` (optional): Surplus Intelligence API key used only by the server for paid fallback. It is never sent
  to gateway clients. When both paid-provider keys are configured, the gateway selects the provider by model family and
  fails over between them on provider authentication, quota, and upstream failures.
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` (optional): Defaults to `*`.
- `UOS_API_KEY_DEFAULT_USAGE_LIMIT` (optional): Default usage limit for new API keys in requests/week. Defaults to `50`.
- `UOS_API_KEY_DEFAULT_EXPIRY_DAYS` (optional): Default expiration for new API keys in days. Defaults to `90`.

## Output-token caps by endpoint and provider

`POST /v1/chat/completions` uses the OpenAI `max_completion_tokens` output cap. `POST /v1/responses` uses the OpenAI
`max_output_tokens` output cap. Both are positive-integer output caps, not quota or health indicators. Their transport
behavior depends on the selected route:

| Request and provider                           | Gateway/upstream behavior                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Chat Completions to Codex                      | `max_completion_tokens` is translated to the Codex Responses field `max_output_tokens`.    |
| Responses to Codex                             | `max_output_tokens` is forwarded as `max_output_tokens`.                                   |
| Chat Completions to Cerebras (`gpt-oss-120b`)  | `max_completion_tokens` is forwarded unchanged to Cerebras.                                |
| Chat Completions to Metered Responses fallback | `max_completion_tokens` is translated to the fallback Responses field `max_output_tokens`. |
| Responses to Metered Responses fallback        | `max_output_tokens` is forwarded unchanged to the fallback Responses endpoint.             |
| Chat Completions to Surplus Responses fallback | `max_completion_tokens` is translated to the fallback Responses field `max_output_tokens`. |
| Responses to Surplus Responses fallback        | `max_output_tokens` is forwarded unchanged to the fallback Responses endpoint.             |

Do not swap these fields between endpoints: Chat Completions accepts `max_completion_tokens`, while Responses accepts
`max_output_tokens`. Metered and Surplus fallback both receive the Responses field `max_output_tokens`; the cap limits
generated output and does not report the provider's remaining paid capacity.

## Chat Completions provider contract

`gpt-oss-120b` is sent to Cerebras as a non-streaming Chat Completions request. Its standard `temperature` and
`max_completion_tokens` fields are forwarded unchanged. If a client requests `stream: true`, the gateway keeps the
client-facing SSE contract but buffers the Cerebras completion first, and returns
`x-uos-warning: gpt_oss_stream_downgraded`. Successful downgraded requests remain HTTP `200`; a non-2xx status would
make compatible clients treat the completed response as an error. The existing Terra/Codex Chat Completions path
translates `max_completion_tokens` to the upstream Responses `max_output_tokens` cap. Terra/Codex does not support
`temperature`; the gateway intentionally omits it and returns `x-uos-warning: temperature_ignored` rather than silently
treating it as a cost or behavior control.

When a provider supplies an opaque request ID, the gateway preserves its bounded, header-safe value as
`x-uos-provider-request-id` and in terminal response telemetry as `providerRequestId` / `provider_request_id`. It is a
support-correlation value only, never a credential or provider response body.

On a Cerebras `429`, the gateway also forwards Cerebras' documented `x-ratelimit-*` capacity headers. These values
describe the shared server-side `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` capacity, not a per-user UOS quota, and are not forwarded for other
upstream statuses.

## Admin: upload/validate Codex auth.json

This validates a posted `auth.json` against the upstream Codex endpoint and stores it in a two-account Deno KV pool.
Uploading a different `account_id` fills the empty slot; uploading an existing `account_id` rotates that account's
tokens without changing its slot. A third distinct account is rejected with `409 codex_auth_pool_full`.

Inference chooses a starting account randomly, which distributes independent requests without a per-request KV counter.
If that account returns `401` after refresh or returns `429`, the request is retried on the other account. Only a
failure from both accounts reaches the existing gateway error or paid-fallback path.

During validation, the server seeds the versioned catalog for the validated client version and updates the normalized
snapshot used by unversioned `/v1/models` and the default model picker. Replacing authentication invalidates all
previously cached versioned catalogs. Future Codex versions are fetched dynamically when they first request
`/v1/models?client_version=...`; no Codex binary or manual catalog upload is required.

Treat `auth.json` as a secret (it contains refresh tokens). Use the repo helper CLI:

```bash
# Run from an existing ai.ubq.fi checkout (the directory containing deno.json and scripts/upload-codex-auth.ts).
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN="..."
deno task upload:auth --url https://ai.ubq.fi --auth-json ~/.codex/auth.json
deno task upload:auth --url https://ai.ubq.fi --auth-json /secure/path/to/second-account-auth.json
```

The helper CLI uses `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN`. If a local `codex` package is available, the helper sends its client version as
a hint so upstream returns the current Codex product catalog. The auth KV value is a hard-cutover pool record; after
deploying this change, upload both intended accounts because a pre-cutover single-account value is not read as a pool.

## Admin: create/manage UBQ API keys

API keys are stored in Deno KV (hashed) and are only returned once on creation. Keys are prefixed with `u_` for easy
identification.

**Default Limits:**

- **Expiration**: 90 days (can be overridden with `--expires` or `--expires-at-ms`)
- **Usage Limit**: 50 requests/week (can be overridden with `--usage-limit`)
- **Reset Period**: Weekly (7 days, automatic)

Expiration:

- `expires_at_ms` is a Unix epoch millisecond timestamp; `-1` means "does not expire".
- Expired keys are rejected like revoked keys.

Usage Limits:

- `usage_limit_requests` sets maximum requests per week; `-1` means unlimited.
- `usage_requests` tracks current usage; resets automatically every 7 days.
- `usage_reset_at_ms` is the next reset timestamp.
- Rate limit errors (429) include reset time in the message.

Create (token only):

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN="..."
deno task ubq-ai admin keys create "example key"
```

Create (expires in a week):

```bash
deno task ubq-ai admin keys create "tmp key" --expires week
```

Create (with custom usage limit):

```bash
deno task ubq-ai admin keys create "high-volume key" --usage-limit 1000
```

Create (unlimited usage):

```bash
deno task ubq-ai admin keys create "unlimited key" --usage-limit unlimited
```

## Admin: kernel auth usage limits (GitHub token)

Kernel-attested GitHub token auth is tracked per `owner/repo` and can also be limited per org (`owner`). The default
limit is unlimited until an admin sets a per-repo or per-org limit. Limits reset weekly by default, unless `window_ms`
is provided.

Get repo usage/limit (admin):

```bash
export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN="..."
curl -sS "https://ai.ubq.fi/admin/kernel-usage?owner=acme&repo=demo" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN" \
  | jq
```

Get org usage/limit (admin):

```bash
export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN="..."
curl -sS "https://ai.ubq.fi/admin/kernel-usage?owner=acme&scope=org" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN" \
  | jq
```

Set repo limit (admin):

```bash
export DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN="..."
curl -sS https://ai.ubq.fi/admin/kernel-usage \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## Local dev

```bash
export UOS_AI_TOKEN="dev-token"
export CODEX_AUTH_JSON_B64="$(base64 < ~/.codex/auth.json | tr -d '\n')"
deno task dev
```

`deno task dev` binds to loopback, disables admin authentication for the loopback server, and injects the admin token
set as `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` from the fallback chain `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN_UBIQUITY_DAO` → `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` →
`local-dev-admin` (the `.env` file is read first). The `/admin` dashboard therefore opens with super-admin access and no
sign-in on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The injected token lives in the server process only — `.env` values are not
re-exported to your shell, and the admin credential never flows into separate commands. `deno task dev:local` behaves
the same way; `deno task admin:models` (and its `:spark` variant) fall back to `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN_UBIQUITY_DAO` from
your shell, and against a loopback `BASE_URL` (the default) they send no token at all — only a non-loopback `BASE_URL`
requires one, exactly like the loopback server itself, which has admin authentication disabled.

Admin authentication is disabled only when the server's actual TCP listener, the request's TCP peer, and the request URL
are all loopback. A local reverse proxy or tunnel that forwards an external request to this loopback server is
indistinguishable from a direct local connection (its upstream peer is loopback and the `Host` header is client
controlled), so the bypass also applies there: never expose the loopback dev server to the network. Startup fails if you
make the listener public (e.g. `--host 0.0.0.0`), in Deno Deploy, with a duplicated flag, or with an unknown server
argument. To require a real admin token even on loopback (for example to exercise the sign-in flow), start the server
directly without the baked-in flag:

```bash
deno serve --host 127.0.0.1 --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --unstable-kv serve.ts
```

The equivalent direct command that mirrors the dev task's behavior must place the application flag after the entry
point:

```bash
deno serve --host 127.0.0.1 --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --unstable-kv serve.ts --disable-admin-auth
```

## Deno KV migration

Use the KV migration helper to inspect a Deno 1/Classic KV database, export it, map it into a local Deno 2 KV, and
validate it before any production import.

```bash
export DENO_KV_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
SOURCE_KV="https://api.deno.com/databases/<database-id>/connect"

deno task kv:probe --source "$SOURCE_KV"
deno task kv:export --source "$SOURCE_KV" --out .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson
deno task kv:analyze --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --profile local
deno task kv:import-local --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --db .kv-migration/deno1.sqlite3 --profile local --overwrite
deno task kv:validate --db .kv-migration/deno1.sqlite3 --strict
```

For production, run the remote import as a dry run first. Remote imports do not write until `--write` is passed.

```bash
DEST_KV="https://api.deno.com/databases/<deno-2-database-id>/connect"
deno task kv:analyze --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --profile prod
deno task kv:import-remote --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --dest "$DEST_KV" --profile prod --overwrite
deno task kv:import-remote --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --dest "$DEST_KV" --profile prod --overwrite --write
deno task kv:validate --target "$DEST_KV" --strict
```

For the KV read-budget v2 hard cutover, export the production database first. Then run the incident migration in two
tightly spaced phases so requests completed by the old revision during deployment are not lost:

```bash
deno task kv:export --source "$DEST_KV" --out .kv-migration/pre-kv-read-v2.ndjson

# Phase 1: run immediately before merging, while only the old revision writes bounded usage.
deno task kv:incident-v2 --target "$DEST_KV"

# Merge, wait for the exact production revision to become healthy, and drain every old-revision request before rerunning.
deno task kv:incident-v2 --target "$DEST_KV"
```

The first run atomically seeds each current bounded counter with its legacy count and records a per-key/window migration
baseline. It must report `handoff_phase: "predeploy_seed"`. The second run must report
`handoff_phase: "postdeploy_reconcile"`; it atomically adds only the positive legacy delta observed since phase 1, so
concurrent increments from the new revision are preserved. Repeating phase 2 is safe and reports a zero
`legacy_usage_delta_applied` once caught up, including when a bounded key moved to a new window during deployment.

Phase 1 requires exclusive access to the v2 counters: do not issue bounded requests through a PR preview, staging
revision, local process, or any other new-revision deployment that shares the destination KV from before phase 1 until
the production cutover. The old production revision may continue writing only the legacy counters during this interval.
Do not merge if phase 1 reports any other handoff phase.

After deployment, first confirm the exact production revision is healthy and every old-revision request has drained,
including requests that were already waiting on a non-streaming upstream response. Then run phase 2 until it reports
`postdeploy_reconcile`. Exact handoff is complete only after **two spaced post-deploy observations** both report zero
`legacy_usage_delta_applied`; any non-zero observation restarts that two-observation streak. Validation must also
succeed. Post-deploy reconciliation deliberately retains non-active counter and baseline versions so it cannot delete a
new-window increment racing the migration; validation requires the active counter and baseline without treating retained
versions as errors. The same runs also migrate the paid-fallback ledger and write compact runtime configuration.

If the new Deno Deploy database is only reachable from the app runtime, use the super-admin HTTP importer. It writes
through the deployed app's own `Deno.openKv()` connection and is also dry-run by default:

```bash
BASE_URL="https://ai.ubq.fi"
deno task kv:import-http --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --base-url "$BASE_URL" --profile prod --overwrite
deno task kv:import-http --in .kv-migration/deno1.ndjson --base-url "$BASE_URL" --profile prod --overwrite --write
deno task kv:validate-http --base-url "$BASE_URL" --strict
```

The `local` profile imports durable settings plus Codex auth/model records and legacy rows for replay. The `prod`
profile imports modern durable settings only: it skips `codex_auth` and `codex_models` because the deploy workflow
refreshes authentication and seeds the normalized model snapshot from upstream validation, and it skips legacy
`["key", ...]` rows by default. Runtime-only state such as passkey sessions, WebAuthn challenges, embedding jobs, and
rate windows is skipped.
