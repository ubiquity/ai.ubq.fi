/**
 * Trusted recorded-upstream replay transport for sentinel regression tests.
 *
 * It converts an already-validated SentinelUpstreamTrace (see
 * src/sentinel_upstream_capture.ts) into a fetch transport that reproduces the
 * recorded upstream attempt sequence: the exact provider route per attempt in
 * recorded order, the exact recorded chunk boundaries, and the recorded
 * terminal semantics (eof, read_error, fetch_error, cancelled). It never
 * invokes the global fetch and never falls through to a real service: a
 * request whose URL is not the exact route of the next recorded attempt is a
 * permanent failure and rejects with a TypeError.
 *
 * Every failure is a fixed static message: no URL, body, token or header value
 * is ever included in an error, snapshot or assertion text. The helper performs
 * no sanitization and no causal-success attestation; replayed raw bytes remain
 * restricted capture evidence.
